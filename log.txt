--Simplify event handling

We have two event handler functions in App: navClicked and pClicked.
The first changes the view based on which navigation link has been
clicked. The second changes the value of a variable (which then
updates the display).

In both cases, event.detail is used: to determine which view to
switch to, and what value to put into the variable.

Lets replace these two functions with a single event handler, and
in the functions that run when a click happens, pass an object with
two elements: type of event (view switch or parameter value set),
and value (what is now being passed as event.detail).
